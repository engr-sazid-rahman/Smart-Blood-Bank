# Smart Blood Bank 🩸

A Java-based console application designed to manage blood donor records efficiently. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles within a real-world scenario relevant to Bangladesh.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Donor Registration:** Add new donors with details including Name, Phone, and Blood Group.
* **Smart Eligibility Check:** The system automatically calculates if a donor is eligible to donate based on their last donation date (3-month rule).
* **Search Functionality:** Quickly find donors by specific blood group (e.g., "O+", "AB-").
* **Data Validation:** Ensures dates are input in the correct format.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Language:** Java (JDK 8 or higher)
* **Concepts Used:**
    * **Inheritance:** `Person` class extended by `Donor` class.
    * **Encapsulation:** Private fields with public getters/setters.
    * **Polymorphism:** Overriding `toString()` method.
    * **Abstraction:** Logic separation in `BloodBank` class.
